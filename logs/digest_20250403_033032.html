<h2>🧑‍🏫 Skill Up: Custom Tutorial</h2>
## 🛠️ Skill Up Tutorial: LangGraph basics

**Objective:** Implement a simple LangGraph that directs the flow of execution between two LLM calls based on the output of the first call, achieving a basic decision-making graph.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Nodes:**  Represent individual steps/operations within the graph (e.g., LLM calls, data transformations).  Think of them as functions/units of work.
*   **Edges:** Define the connections/transitions between nodes. LangGraph supports conditional edges which allow routing of the execution flow.
*   **Graph:**  The overarching structure that orchestrates the execution flow.

**Prerequisites:**

*   `langchain==0.2.0`
*   `langgraph==0.0.38`
*   `langchain-openai==0.1.0`
*   `openai` (Ensure you have an OpenAI API key set as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1.  **Setup:** Import necessary libraries.
    ```python
    from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
    import os
    from typing import TypedDict, Dict, Any

    # Set the API key (or make sure it's in your environment variables).
    # os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY" # Uncomment and replace if not already set

    ```
    *Explanation:* Imports required libraries for prompting, LLM interaction, and graph definition.  Uncomment and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key if you haven't already configured it in your environment variables.

2.  **Define the State:** Define a schema for the state that will be passed between nodes.
    ```python
    class GraphState(TypedDict):
        "Represents the state of our graph"
        query: str
        answer: str
    ```
    *Explanation:* This defines the data structure (a dictionary) that each node can access and modify. We use `TypedDict` for type safety. In this case, our graph will store a `query` and the `answer` that gets built up.

3.  **Define the Nodes:** Create the individual nodes of the graph. These will be LLM calls in this example.
    ```python
    def query_llm(state: GraphState) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """First LLM call"""
        prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("You are a helpful AI assistant.  Please answer the users question: {query}")
        model = ChatOpenAI()
        chain = prompt | model
        response = chain.invoke({"query": state['query']})
        return {"answer": response.content}

    def summarize_answer(state: GraphState) -> Dict[str, str]:
        """Second LLM call, summarizes the answer from the first"""
        prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template("You are a helpful AI assistant. Please summarize the following content: {answer}")
        model = ChatOpenAI()
        chain = prompt | model
        response = chain.invoke({"answer": state['answer']})
        return {"answer": response.content}
    ```
    *Explanation:* These functions represent our nodes. They take the `GraphState` as input and return a dictionary representing updates to the state.  Each uses a simple prompt and calls the OpenAI Chat model. `query_llm` answers the user's question, and `summarize_answer` summarizes the response.  Crucially, note that *keys* returned in the dictionary MUST match the keys defined in the `GraphState` `TypedDict`.

4. **Define the conditional node:**  Define a function to determine which node to go to next.
    ```python
    def should_summarize(state: GraphState):
        """
        Determines whether to summarize the current answer
        """
        answer = state.get("answer", "")
        if len(answer) > 50:
            return "summarize"
        else:
            return "end"
    ```
    *Explanation:* This function takes the current state as input and returns a string indicating the next node to execute. Here, if the first LLM answer is more than 50 characters, we summarize, otherwise, we end the graph.

5.  **Build the Graph:**  Assemble the nodes and edges.
    ```python
    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

    builder = StateGraph(GraphState)

    builder.add_node("query_llm", query_llm)
    builder.add_node("summarize", summarize_answer)

    builder.add_conditional_edges(
        "query_llm",
        should_summarize,
        {
            "summarize": "summarize", #if `should_summarize` returns "summarize", go to the "summarize" node.
            "end": END #if `should_summarize` returns "end", end the graph.
        }
    )

    builder.add_edge("summarize", END)  # Summarize always leads to end

    graph = builder.compile()
    ```
    *Explanation:* This section constructs the graph.  `StateGraph(GraphState)` initializes the graph with the defined state schema. `add_node` adds the LLM calls as nodes. `add_conditional_edges` adds an edge between the first node and the second, with the `should_summarize` function determining the next node. `add_edge` adds the edge between the summarize node and the end of the graph. The result is then compiled to create a runnable graph.

6.  **Running the Example:**
    ```python
    # Example usage / main execution block
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        inputs = {"query": "What is the capital of France?"}
        result = graph.invoke(inputs)
        print(result)
    ```
    *Explanation:* This code provides example usage. We define an input query and then invoke the graph with this query. The result, containing the final state of the graph, is then printed. This contains the initial question, the answer, and the summarized answer if the answer was long enough to warrant summarization.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **API Key Management:** Ensure your OpenAI API key is securely managed, ideally through environment variables, not hardcoded in your scripts.
*   **Error Handling:**  In a real application, implement error handling (e.g., using `try...except` blocks) within the node functions to gracefully handle potential LLM call failures or other exceptions.

**Next Steps / Further Learning:**

*   **LangGraph Documentation:** [https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph) (Official documentation)
*   **LangGraph Recipes:** [https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/tree/main/examples](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/tree/main/examples) (More complex and real-world examples).
