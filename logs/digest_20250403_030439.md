## 🧑‍🏫 Skill Up: Custom Tutorial

## 🛠️ Skill Up Tutorial: LangGraph basics

**Objective:** Build a simple LangGraph that decides whether to generate a joke or a poem based on user input and then executes the chosen path.

**Core Concepts:**

*   **Nodes:** Functions that process data within the graph. Each node takes input and produces output.
*   **Edges:** Direct the flow of data between nodes.  Conditional edges determine the path based on the node output.

**Prerequisites:**

*   `langgraph==0.0.36`
*   `langchain==0.1.10`
*   `langchain-core==0.1.26`
*   `typing==3.7.4.3`
*   `typing_extensions==4.7.1`

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1.  **Setup:** Import necessary libraries.

    ```python
    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
    from typing import TypedDict, Dict
    from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, PromptTemplate
    from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
    from langchain_core.runnables import chain
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

    # Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
    import os
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

    # Model to use
    model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7) # keep it general for flexibility
    ```

    *Explanation:* Imports the core LangGraph modules and langchain modules. Sets up your OpenAI API key (replace with your actual key). Also sets up a general llm Model.

2.  **Define State:** Define the state object that will be passed between nodes.

    ```python
    class GraphState(TypedDict):
        keys: Dict
    ```

    *Explanation:*  `GraphState` defines the structure of the data passed between nodes. Here, it's a dictionary named `keys` which will hold our input and the selected path. This is minimal but crucial for LangGraph's functionality.

3.  **Define Nodes:** Create nodes that generate either a joke or a poem.

    ```python
    def generate_joke(state: GraphState):
        """
        Generates a joke based on the input.
        """
        prompt_template = """
        CONTEXT: You are a world-class comedian.
        USER QUESTION: {input}
        """
        prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)

        chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser()
        joke = chain.invoke({"input": state["keys"]["input"]})
        return {"keys": {"joke": joke}}

    def generate_poem(state: GraphState):
        """
        Generates a poem based on the input.
        """

        prompt_template = """
        CONTEXT: You are a world-class poet.
        USER QUESTION: {input}
        """
        prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template)

        chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser()
        poem = chain.invoke({"input": state["keys"]["input"]})
        return {"keys": {"poem": poem}}
    ```

    *Explanation:* Each function is a node. They take the `GraphState`, process the input, and return an updated `GraphState`. Here, they generate content (joke or poem) based on the user's `input` and save it to the relevant key in the state. Each node returns an updated key.

4. **Define the decision Node:** Create the node that decides between generating a joke or a poem.

   ```python
    def decide_joke_or_poem(state: GraphState):
        """
        Decides whether to generate a joke or a poem based on the input.
        """
        input_query = state['keys']['input']

        # Prompt to decide whether to generate a joke or a poem.
        template = """Given the input query below, decide whether the prompt should be used to generate a joke or a poem.
        Return `joke` if the prompt is best used to generate a joke. Return `poem` if the prompt is best used to generate a poem.
        query: {input}
        decision:"""
        prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)
        string_chain = prompt | model | StrOutputParser()
        response = string_chain.invoke({"input": input_query})

        if "joke" in response.lower():
            return "joke"
        elif "poem" in response.lower():
            return "poem"
        else:
            return "joke" # default, just in case the model hallucinates.

   ```
   *Explanation:* This is the decision node.  It inspects the initial user input and determines the appropriate path: generating a joke or a poem. The node's output ("joke" or "poem") is used by the conditional edges to route the graph. The node returns either "joke" or "poem" which is then used to route the graph to the correct node to invoke.

5.  **Build the Graph:** Create the LangGraph and define the nodes and edges.

    ```python
    builder = StateGraph(GraphState)

    builder.add_node("joke", generate_joke)
    builder.add_node("poem", generate_poem)
    builder.add_node("decide", decide_joke_or_poem)


    builder.add_edge("decide", "joke", conditional=lambda x: x == "joke")
    builder.add_edge("decide", "poem", conditional=lambda x: x == "poem")

    builder.set_entry_point("decide")
    builder.add_edge("joke", END)
    builder.add_edge("poem", END)

    graph = builder.compile()
    ```

    *Explanation:* This code defines the LangGraph itself.  We add the previously defined nodes ("joke", "poem", "decide").  Crucially, we define *conditional edges*. The output of the `decide` node dictates which edge is followed. If `decide` returns "joke", the graph goes to the "joke" node; if it returns "poem", it goes to the "poem" node. The `set_entry_point` tells the graph where to start running, and `END` indicates a termination point.

6.  **Running the Example:** Show how to run the example.

    ```python
    # Example usage / main execution block
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        inputs = {"keys": {"input": "Tell me something funny about cats"}}
        result = graph.invoke(inputs)
        print(result)

        inputs = {"keys": {"input": "Write a poem about the sunset."}}
        result = graph.invoke(inputs)
        print(result)
    ```

    *Explanation:* This code demonstrates how to run the LangGraph. It creates an input dictionary with the user query.  The `graph.invoke()` method executes the graph and returns the final state. The output state contains the generated "joke" or "poem" (depending on the input).

**Key Considerations:**

*   **API Key Management:** Never hardcode your API keys in your code. Use environment variables or a secrets management system.
*   **Error Handling:**  Implement error handling (e.g., try-except blocks) within nodes to gracefully manage potential failures (e.g., API outages).

**Next Steps / Further Learning:**

*   [LangGraph Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph): Official LangGraph documentation for in-depth information.
*   [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/):  Understand LCEL which provides a composable syntax for building LLM chains and is a key component in using LangGraph.
