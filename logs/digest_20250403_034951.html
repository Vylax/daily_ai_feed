<h2>🧑‍🏫 Skill Up: Custom Tutorial - Topic Extraction Failed</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Build a simple LangGraph that routes based on the output of an LLM to either generate a final answer or refine the original user query.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes:</strong> Independent computational units (LLMs, functions) within the graph.</li>
<li><strong>Edges:</strong> Define the flow of execution between nodes, either conditional (based on output) or unconditional.</li>
<li><strong>StateGraph:</strong> The core LangGraph class that manages the graph structure and execution flow.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>langchain==0.2.0</code></li>
<li><code>langgraph==0.0.36</code></li>
<li><code>langchain_core==0.2.0</code></li>
<li><code>langchain_openai==0.1.2</code>  (or other LLM provider, adjust setup accordingly)</li>
<li><code>os</code> (built-in Python module)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Implementation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Import necessary libraries and set up LLM API key.</p>
<p>```python
import os
from langchain_core.runnables import chain
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END</p>
<h1>Set your OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider)</h1>
<p>os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual API key
```</p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em> Imports required modules and sets the API key for the LLM. Ensure <code>YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY</code> is replaced with your actual key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define Nodes:</strong>  Create LLM and routing functions.</p>
<p>```python</p>
<h1>1. LLM to generate a final answer.</h1>
<p>def generate_answer(state):
    messages = state['messages']
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(messages)
    model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
    answer = prompt | model
    return {"answer": answer.invoke({})}</p>
<h1>2. LLM to refine the query.</h1>
<p>def refine_query(state):
    messages = state['messages']
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
        messages + [AIMessage(content="Please provide more context to your question.")]
    )
    model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
    refined_query = prompt | model
    return {"messages": messages + [AIMessage(content=refined_query.invoke({}).content)]}
```</p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em> <code>generate_answer</code> uses an LLM to create a final answer based on the current state. <code>refine_query</code> uses an LLM to generate a refined question, adding context, and updates the 'messages' in the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define Routing Logic:</strong> Function to decide which node to go to next.</p>
<p><code>python
def should_refine(state):
    messages = state['messages']
    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
        ("system", "You are a helpful assistant that decides whether to refine the query."),
        ("user", "{messages}"),
        ("assistant", "Should I refine this? Respond with 'yes' or 'no'.")
    ])
    model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
    response = prompt | model
    choice = response.invoke({"messages": messages}).content.strip()
    if "yes" in choice.lower():
        return "refine"
    else:
        return "generate"</code></p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em> <code>should_refine</code> uses an LLM to decide whether the current query requires refinement based on the 'messages' in the state.  It returns "refine" or "generate" which will be used as the edge keys in the graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build the Graph:</strong>  Construct the <code>StateGraph</code>.</p>
<p>```python
workflow = StateGraph(state_keys=['messages'])</p>
<p>workflow.add_node("generate", generate_answer)
workflow.add_node("refine", refine_query)</p>
<p>workflow.add_edge("refine", "refine") # loop for more context
workflow.add_conditional_edges("refine", should_refine, {
    "generate": "generate",
})
workflow.add_edge("generate", END)</p>
<h1>Compile the graph</h1>
<p>app = workflow.compile()
```</p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em>  This defines the graph structure. Nodes "generate" and "refine" are added.  A conditional edge from "refine" allows looping back to "refine" (adding more context) or proceeding to "generate" based on the <code>should_refine</code> function's output. The <code>app = workflow.compile()</code> creates an executable graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define Message State:</strong></p>
<p>```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any</p>
<p>def load_messages(messages: List[Dict[str, Any]]):
    return {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=m["content"]) for m in messages]}
<code>``
*Explanation:* Converts messages to a list of</code>HumanMessage` objects which are understood by Langchain.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Running the Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python">if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    # Initial user query
    input_data = {&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;content&quot;: &quot;What is the capital of France?&quot;}]}

    # Run the graph
    results = app.invoke(input=load_messages(input_data[&quot;messages&quot;]))

    # Print the final answer
    print(results)
</code></pre>

<p><em>Explanation:</em> This initializes the graph with a sample user query and runs it using <code>app.invoke()</code>. It then prints the final result.  You may need to rerun this entire script after updating the API key, as some caches/environments will save the old (non-functional) key.</p>
<p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Key Management:</strong> Securely manage your API keys. Avoid hardcoding them in production code (use environment variables or secrets management).</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Implement error handling in your nodes (e.g., using <code>try...except</code> blocks) to gracefully handle potential LLM API errors or other runtime exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next Steps / Further Learning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LangGraph official documentation: <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph">https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph</a></li>
<li>Langchain Routing: <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/routing">https://python.langchain.com/docs/expression_language/routing</a></li>
