<h2>🧑‍🏫 Skill Up: Custom Tutorial - Topic Extraction Failed</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Build a simple LangGraph that acts as a basic decision-making agent, choosing between generating text or terminating.</p>
<p><strong>Core Concepts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes:</strong> Functions or LangChain primitives that perform specific tasks. In LangGraph, these are the building blocks of your graph.</li>
<li><strong>Edges:</strong> Define the flow of execution between nodes.  Conditional edges allow branching based on a node's output.</li>
<li><strong>Graph State:</strong>  Represents the information shared and updated as the graph executes.  This is often a dictionary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>langchain==0.1.10</code></li>
<li><code>langgraph==0.0.34</code></li>
<li><code>langchain_openai==0.0.6</code></li>
<li><code>typing-inspect==0.9.0</code></li>
<li><code>typing_extensions==4.9.0</code></li>
<li><code>openai</code> (latest)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Implementation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> Import necessary libraries and configure OpenAI API key.</p>
<p>```python
import os
from typing import TypedDict, Literal</p>
<p>from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
from langchain_core.runnables import chain
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI</p>
<p>from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END</p>
<h1>Set your OpenAI API key (replace with your key or use environment variables)</h1>
<p>os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```</p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em> Imports necessary modules and sets up the OpenAI API key.  Replace <code>"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"</code> with your actual key or a method to retrieve it from environment variables for security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define the Graph State:</strong> Create a class to hold the state of the graph.</p>
<p><code>python
class GraphState(TypedDict):
    messages: list
    next: str</code></p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em> <code>GraphState</code> defines the structure of the state dictionary used within the LangGraph. In this minimal example, it holds the conversation <code>messages</code> and the decision on which node to visit <code>next</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Define Nodes:</strong> Create the nodes of the graph: <code>generate</code> and <code>decide</code>.</p>
<p>```python
model = ChatOpenAI()</p>
<p>generate_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name="messages"),
    ("user", "Generate a follow up response."),
])</p>
<p>generate = generate_prompt | model</p>
<p>def decide(state: GraphState):
    """Choose whether to generate more or end."""
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1].content.lower()
    if "goodbye" in last_message or "bye" in last_message:
        return "end"
    else:
        return "generate"
```</p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em>
*   <code>generate</code>: This node uses a ChatOpenAI model to generate a response based on the current conversation history. It's a LangChain chain.
*   <code>decide</code>: This node examines the last message and decides whether to generate another response or end the conversation based on the presence of goodbye-related keywords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build the Graph:</strong> Define the graph structure using <code>StateGraph</code>.</p>
<p>```python
builder = StateGraph(GraphState)</p>
<p>builder.add_node("generate", generate)
builder.add_node("decide", decide)</p>
<p>builder.set_entry_point("generate")</p>
<p>builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "decide",
    {
        "generate": "generate",
        "end": END
    }
)</p>
<p>builder.add_edge("generate", "decide")</p>
<p>graph = builder.compile()
```</p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em>
*   We initialize a <code>StateGraph</code> with our <code>GraphState</code> type.
*   <code>add_node</code> adds our <code>generate</code> and <code>decide</code> functions as nodes to the graph.
*   <code>set_entry_point</code> designates the <code>generate</code> node as the starting point of the graph.
*   <code>add_conditional_edges</code> adds an edge from the <code>decide</code> node to either the <code>generate</code> node or the <code>END</code> node based on its output.
*   <code>add_edge</code> adds an unconditional edge from the <code>generate</code> node to the <code>decide</code> node, setting up the loop.
*   <code>compile</code> finalizes the graph definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Running the Example:</strong> Show how to run the complete minimal example.</p>
<p>```python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage</p>
<p>if <strong>name</strong> == "<strong>main</strong>":
    # Initialize the graph state
    inputs = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hello, how are you?")]}</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code># Run the graph
for output in graph.stream(inputs):
    for key, value in output.items():
        print(f&quot;Node '{key}':&quot;)
        print(value)
    print(&quot;\n---\n&quot;)

# Example to add a goodbye message
inputs = {&quot;messages&quot;: [HumanMessage(content=&quot;Goodbye&quot;)]}

# Run the graph
for output in graph.stream(inputs):
    for key, value in output.items():
        print(f&quot;Node '{key}':&quot;)
        print(value)
    print(&quot;\n---\n&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>
<p><em>Explanation:</em>
*   We initialize the graph with a starting message "Hello, how are you?".
*   <code>graph.stream</code> executes the graph, yielding the output of each node at each step.  We iterate and print the outputs to the console.
*   The second part adds a "Goodbye" message to the history which triggers the 'end' condition and terminates the graph.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Key Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State Management:</strong>  LangGraph relies heavily on the <code>GraphState</code>. Understanding how to update and access it correctly is crucial for building complex graphs.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong>  Consider adding error handling within nodes to gracefully manage potential exceptions from external calls (e.g., OpenAI API errors).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next Steps / Further Learning:</strong></p>
