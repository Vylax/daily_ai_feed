## 🛠️ Skill Up Tutorial: LangGraph basics

**Objective:** Build a minimal LangChain application leveraging LangGraph to manage and query a knowledge graph generated from a text document.

**Core Concepts:**

1. **Knowledge Graph Construction:** LangGraph builds a graph representing relationships within text.  Nodes are concepts, edges are relationships.
2. **Graph Traversal & Querying:**  You use a graph database (like Neo4j) to store and efficiently query the knowledge graph.  LangGraph facilitates this interaction.
3. **LangChain Integration:** LangGraph seamlessly integrates with LangChain, enabling you to combine graph-based reasoning with LLM capabilities.

**Prerequisites:**

* `python>=3.9`
* `langgraph>=0.0.30` (Install via `pip install langgraph`)
* `neo4j` (Install via `pip install neo4j`)  *Note: Requires a Neo4j instance running locally.*
* `langchain` (Install via `pip install langchain`)

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

1. **Setup:** Import necessary libraries.

```python
import langgraph
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langgraph import Neo4jGraph
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv # For managing API keys
```

2. **Load and Split Document:** Load a text file and split it into chunks.

```python
load_dotenv() # Load environment variables from .env file (recommended for API keys)
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") # Get OpenAI API key from environment

loader = TextLoader('my_document.txt') # Replace 'my_document.txt' with your file
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```
*Explanation:* This loads a text file, splitting it into manageable chunks for processing.  Replace `'my_document.txt'` with your document's path.

3. **Create Embeddings & Vectorstore:** Create embeddings and store them in a vector database.

```python
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
db = FAISS.from_documents(docs, embeddings)
```
*Explanation:* This creates embeddings for each document chunk using OpenAI's embedding model and stores them in a FAISS vector database for efficient similarity search.


4. **Build Knowledge Graph:** Build the knowledge graph using LangGraph and Neo4j.

```python
graph = Neo4jGraph(uri="bolt://localhost:7687", username="neo4j", password="your_neo4j_password") # Replace with your Neo4j credentials
langgraph.build_graph(docs, graph, embeddings)

```
*Explanation:* This uses LangGraph to build a knowledge graph from the document chunks and stores it in your Neo4j database.  Replace placeholder credentials with your Neo4j connection details.


5. **Query the Knowledge Graph:**  Query the graph using Cypher (Neo4j's query language).

```python
query = "MATCH (n:Concept)-[r:RELATES_TO]->(m:Concept) WHERE n.name CONTAINS 'topic1' RETURN n, r, m" #Example query
results = graph.run(query)
print(list(results))
```
*Explanation:* This demonstrates querying the graph. You will need to adapt the Cypher query based on your knowledge graph structure and desired information.

**Running the Example:**

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Steps 2-5 go here
    pass
```

**Key Considerations:**

1. **API Key Management:** Securely manage your OpenAI API key (using environment variables as shown is recommended).
2. **Neo4j Setup:** Ensure your Neo4j instance is running and accessible.  Adjust connection details accordingly.

**Next Steps / Further Learning:**

1. LangGraph Documentation: [https://github.com/microsoft/langgraph](https://github.com/microsoft/langgraph) (Check for the most up-to-date documentation)
2. LangChain Documentation: [https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/) (For advanced LangChain features)


Remember to replace placeholder values (file paths, API keys, Neo4j credentials) with your actual information. This tutorial provides a minimal working example; more complex scenarios will require more sophisticated graph designs and queries.
